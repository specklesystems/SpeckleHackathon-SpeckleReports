# Repo structure

This repo contains the code for the a **carbon cost report generator** developed on a 1-day hackathon during our company retreat on October 2021.

[**We wrote a blog post about it!**]()

> Go see the app live [here]()

It is divided into 2 folders:

- `frontend/`: A `vue.js` application allowing to setup carbon report generation for any stream, and view the resulting report.
- `server/`: A `FastAPI` Python server that receives notifications of each new commit in a stream, and generates a carbon report based on the data.

## Frontend

First, install all necesary dependencies by running `npm install` on the `frontend/` folder.

Inside the `frontend/` folder, you'll find a file named `.env.local-example`. Rename it to `.env.local` and fill in the variables accordingly.

> The app ID and app secret are obtained when creating a new app in your [Speckle profile section](https://speckle.xyz/profile).

Then run `npm run serve` to run the app in development mode.

To build the app run `npm run build`

## Server

To run the app, use the provided `Dockerfile`

To run the app, create a `.env` file based on the `.env_example`, and pass that to docker run via the `--env-file` flag

For debug see the `.vscode/launch.json` for a sample config.

Use the example hooks provided, and the `http://localhost:8000/docs` page to test things.
