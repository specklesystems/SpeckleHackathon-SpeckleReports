# Repo structure

This repo contains the code for the a **carbon cost report generator** based on a hackathon project and modified to use python instead of vue for the frontend.

It is divided into 2 folders:

- `frontend/`: A `Dash` / `Flask` application allowing to setup carbon report generation for any stream, and view the resulting report.
- `server/`: A `FastAPI` Python server that receives notifications of each new commit in a stream, and generates a carbon report based on the data.


This repo contains two apps: the `server` and the `frontend`.

Run the server and frontend locally using the sample `launch.json`.

The server will start at `http://localhost:8000/`. Head to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to make sure everything is working.

The frontend will start at `http://localhost:8050/`. It takes the URL path to find the correct stream and report. To get a report for a commit, append `/streams/STREAM-ID/commits/COMMIT-ID` to the URL.
